A customer has recently attempted to accelerate a kernel that takes up a
significant amount of time in their workflow.  They are not happy with the
current performance they are seeing.  To assist in optimization they have
created a simple benchmark that times the kernel and tests for correctness
within a specified tolerance.  Please modify the kernel to be as fast as
possible and draft a letter to the customer describing the changes and why
they are important.

You can modify the kernel and the launchKernel function to improve
performance.  The data dimensions (dimx and dimy) are to remain the same.
You can change the kernel itself in any way you like, naturally the mathematical 
operation for each output element must be the same within the specified
tolerance.
